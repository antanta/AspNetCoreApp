@*  This view is new for this version of MVC.
    The ViewImports file is a place where we can write code and place common directives to pull in namespaces that our views need.
    If there are namespaces that we commonly use in our views, we can have using directives appear once in our ViewImports file instead
    of having using directives in every view or typing out the full namespace of a class.*@
